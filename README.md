AI-Financial-Signals-Pipeline

🚀 AI-Enhanced Financial Signals Pipeline
Production-ready pipeline for ingesting, engineering, backtesting, and visualizing AI-powered financial trading signals using only free, live, public data.

📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end data engineering and AI signal development — from live data ingestion to feature engineering, machine learning augmentation, and backtesting, built on clean, modular code infrastructure.

It is designed to simulate realistic, production-adaptable pipelines, with a focus on practical signals, explainable models, and scalable architecture, reflecting professional data engineering standards in finance and quant research.

For this project, I optimize for zero-cost, zero-friction ingestion with yfinance and CoinGecko, paired with professional key-based access for macroeconomic signals via FRED — balancing flexibility with proper production discipline

📊 Example Use-Case

“Backtest a simple momentum crossover strategy on S&P 500 stocks, augment with AI meta-signals predicting short-term reversal strength, and visualize performance metrics — all sourced from public, live APIs, with fully modular code.”

💡 Why This Project?

Most stock prediction demos focus on unrealistic goals (e.g., daily price prediction with LSTMs).
This project focuses on realistic alpha signals, explainable feature pipelines, and robust backtesting, reflecting industry practice in financial engineering.

✅ Demonstrates production engineering skills
✅ Demonstrates applied ML for structured data
✅ Shows professional infrastructure clarity, SQL readiness, multi-source integration
