# 🏗️ Data Engineering Portfolio — 2025

Welcome to my **professional data engineering portfolio**, focused on **end-to-end data pipelines**, **practical AI integrations**, and **clean, scalable project structures**.

This repository serves as my **recruiter-friendly showcase**, highlighting:
- ✅ **Live data pipelines** across multiple industries
- ✅ **Explainable AI/ML applications** (no black-box hype)
- ✅ **Production-grade project layouts** — built for **modularity and clarity**
- ✅ 📌 **Focus on process quality** rather than proprietary signals

---

## 🎯 Important Note on Scope

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
> While these projects are **designed to reflect the engineering processes used in professional environments**, they **do not contain proprietary models or signals**.
> - My goal is to **demonstrate architecture, engineering discipline, and analytical rigor**.
> - **Signal logic is simplified** to avoid confidential or firm-specific strategies.
> - These pipelines are **not intended for trading use**, but as **technical capability showcases**.
